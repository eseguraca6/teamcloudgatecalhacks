This is our first hack, and here's our idea: 


Our theme: exclusivity - invite by someone -> club 6/ future friends/ 

we have users making an account, providing their profile of sorts (taste, food, drink, interests, sports, etc) 

we create groups of 6 people based on how close they are (graph th).

we message them for the event. 

we send them an invite, with payment request.

given the payment, you get next message with uber information for pick up.

have a nice dinner! 

map api: locations
capital one: payments (for the whole thing (limo, maybe uber?) to the party). 
att/msg : secure, secret msg
